Low and Slow</h2>

<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking 
technique called <dfn><i>sous vide</i></dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i> 
cooking, you submerge the food (usually <br>vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a 
water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the 
food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking <br>for Geeks</cite>, Jeff 
Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>



<p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill 
Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before 
<time datetime="20161130">November 30</time>.</p>




<p>Location: <br>Baker's Corner, Seekonk, MA<br></p>

<p>Hours: <br>Tuesday to Saturday, 11am to 11pm<br></p>
